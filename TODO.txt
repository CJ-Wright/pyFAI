TODO list:

* include Raster Orientation of images (in pyFAI? in fabio?)
* binning at the Azimuthal Integrator level ?
* have geometries as pluggable classes (!!!) --> Version 2
* recalibration tool (planned for v.1.0) using a poni file and a d-spacing file and an image
* migrate forward version of histogramming on GPU to PyOpenCL (planned for v1.0)
* implement LUT on 2D caking as well + OpenCL version    
* use a fast checksum to store the signature of buffers/array which are on the GPU.
* prepare 2 packages one without OpenCL and one with GPU enabled
* add mask on calibration/recalibration tools

Azimuthal integration for diffraction tomography. Diffraction tomography is an
experiment where 2D diffraction patterns are recorded while performing a 2D
scan, one (the slowest) in rotation around the sample center and the other
(the fastest) along a translation through the sample. Diff_tomo is a script
(based on pyFAI and h5py) which allows the reduction of this 4D dataset into a
3D dataset containing the rotations angle (hundreds), the translation step
(hundreds) and the many diffraction angles (thousands). The resulting dataset
can be opened using PyMca roitool where the 1d dataset has to be selected as
last dimension. This file is not (yet) NeXus compliant. This tool can be used
for mapping experiments if one considers the slow scan direction as the
rotation.

Installation procedure on Windows
=================================

To install pyFAI on a windows PC, you will need a scientific Python stack,
Winpython is a good choice.
http://winpython.sourceforge.net/
The Python2.7 in 64 bits is recommended.

On top of that, you will need FabIO and pyFAI available from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fable/files/fabio/0.2.0/
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyFAI/0.10.2

Once all installed, the scripts related to pyFAI are in c:\winpython*\python27\scripts

Canopy or Anaconda are possible alternative but they are still untested.
